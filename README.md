# Appointment-Management-Application

This is the second part of an Integrated Project which handles and manages Appointments sent through a web application.

Link to the Web Application - 
Both these applications are connected to each other via Amozon Web Services online database service. 

The user sends an appointment request through the web application which will be stored in the cloud database and this Windows application
will retrieve those requests from the cloud and the user of this application will be able to either confirm or reject the appointment.
And mark an accepted appointment as completed if it is completed. Also the application will keep track of all the accepted, rejected 
and completed appointments.
